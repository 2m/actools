[b]This part is very important. Please, read it.[/b]

Since Steam version of AC can’t be started only by running [i]acs.exe[/i], CM has to use some weird ways to do the trick. At the moment there are three strange ways to start the game (apart from direct starting by [b]Naive Starter[/b]). All of them had their flaws, that’s why you have to select one which suits you:

 • [b]Official Starter[/b]
Created after Kunos added official support for custom launchers.
  + Steam-friendly: Steam overlay & archievments will work without any problems;
  + Official: according to Kunos, should be the best way to run the game;
  + Safe: doesn’t mess with [i]AssettoCorsa.exe[/i] or other game files;
  − Slow: use original laucher, which isn’t very fast;
  − Incompatible: can’t be used when original launcher is running.

 • [b]UI Module[/b]
Starts the game through small UI module (module will be installed and enabled automatically).
  + Most Steam-friendly: Steam overlay & archievments will work without any problems, usage time counts as usual;
  + Fast: game will be runned in about one second;
  + Safe: doesn’t mess with [i]AssettoCorsa.exe[/i], only adds its harmless UI module;
  + Compatible: can be used when original launcher is running;
  − Slow-starting: requires original launcher to be starter first.

 • [b]Tricky Starter[/b]
First one added. Uses pretty weird approach, which requires to temporary remove [i]AssettoCorsa.exe[/i] out of the way. On the bright side, this is the only change it does. So:
  + Steam-friendly: Steam overlay & archievments will work without any problems;
  + Tested: firstly was implemented in Cars Manager;
  + Fast: although its weirdness, works faster than Official Starter;
  − Unreliable: using approach could be blocked in any AC update;
  − Tricky: sadly, doesn’t work without Internet connection;
  − Incompatible: can’t be used when original launcher is running;
  − Unsafe: if CM will suddenly get killed, you’ll have to restore [i]AssettoCorsa.exe[/i] from [i]AssettoCorsa_backup.exe[/i] manually;
  − Limited: can’t specify version (32-bit or 64-bit).

 • [b][s]Starter+ (Obsolete)[/s][/b]
Changes original launcher a little. Obsoleted and removed since AC 1.8 release.
  + Steam-friendly: Steam overlay & archievments will work without any problems;
  + Relieable: even though it changes original launcher, it still works as a launcher;
  − Unreliable: if Kunos will change [i]AssettoCorsa.exe[/i], you won’t get new features until addon will be updated;
  − Incompatible: can’t be used when original launcher is running;
  − Slow: use original laucher, which isn’t very fast;
  − Obsolete: Useless since Official starter was added.

 • [b][s]SSE Starter (Obsolete)[/s][/b]
Quite questionable solution. I won’t spread about it too much, just basics:
  + Compatible: doesn’t mess with [i]AssettoCorsa.exe[/i] at all, can work even if it’s runned;
  + Tested: surprisingly solid, works without Internet;
  − Steam-unfriendly: doesn’t save archievments & challenges progress;
  − Obsoletable: you can miss some updates for AC using it;
  − Obsolete: doesn’t work with AC 1.6 without fixing [i]acs_x86.exe[/i].

 • [b]Naive Starter[/b]
CM just starts [i]acs.exe[/i] (or [i]acs_x86.exe[/i]), everything else depends on AC version you use. If you’re using original Steam version — won’t work at all.
