To improve your simracing experience, I recommend you to give a try to:

 • [url="http://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/good-and-bad-weathers.11194/"]Good And Bad Weathers[/url] by Peter Boese — very good looking pack of weather which uses a lot of CM features. For example, each weather is mapped to some real weather type (loaded with real conditions) including specified time and temperature range;

 • [url="http://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/sidekick.11007/"]Sidekick[/url] by Topuz — apart from being a great app displaying a lot of useful information in a compact and stylish way, it’s also a great source of lap times CM can read and display. If you just installed it, you can go to Lap Times section and export your lap times to Sidekick as well;

 • [url="http://www.assettocorsa.net/forum/index.php?threads/real-head-motion-1-0-2.4755/"]Real Head Motion[/url] by Magicfr — running in background, this app focuses first person view camera on the road instead of it being locked to car’s cockpit.
