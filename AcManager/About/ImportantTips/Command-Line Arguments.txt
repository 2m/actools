CM has a bunch of special options you can set by using command-line arguments. Or just create a new [i]Arguments.txt[/i] file in [i]…\AppData\Local\AcTools Content Manager[/i] and write them in it (one argument per line).

Here are some of the arguments:
 [b][mono]--ignore-system-proxy=false[/mono][/b] — use proxy settings from Internet Explorer;
 [b][mono]--disable-logging[/mono][/b] — please, don’t use it now, app could crash in any time, and logs could be very helpful;
 [b][mono]--storage-location=LOCATION[/mono][/b] — change location of data folder (of course, this one should be used only as a command-line argument);
 [b][mono]--ping-concurrency=30[/mono][/b] — number of servers being pinged concurrently;
 [b][mono]--enable-race-ini-restoration=false[/mono][/b] — don’t revert changes in [i]race.ini[/i].
