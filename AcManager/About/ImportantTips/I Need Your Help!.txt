Since AC 1.6 SSE stoped working, and other two (Tricky and Starter+) require write-access to root AC folder, which could be unavailable. Also, both of them require the default launcher (AssettoCorsa.exe) to be replaced, and it could cause some troubles.

So, I’m asking Kunos to add some official support for custom launchers. [url="http://www.assettocorsa.net/forum/index.php?threads/alternative-launchers-official-support.32894/"]Please, show that you’re interested in it![/url]
