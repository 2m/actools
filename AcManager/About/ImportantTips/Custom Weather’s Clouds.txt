Now you can set special clouds for any weather!

Put them into [i]clouds[/i] folder inside weather’s  folder and CM will replace original clouds automatically. And, of course, will revert everything back to normal after the race (or, in case of sudden exit, in a next startup).

Just in case, this behavior could be disabled in Settings/Drive.

[b]UPD:[b] Now it also supports custom PP filters as well. Just put a file named “filter.ini” in a weather’s folder.

Also, at the moment the whole system doesn’t work with online mode (since servers don’t tell which weather they use). I’m trying to find a solution but not sure if it’s possible at all.
