Now you can set special clouds for any weather!

Put them into [i]clouds[/i] folder inside weather’s  folder and CM will replace original clouds automatically. And, of course, will revert everything back to normal after the race (or, in case of sudden exit, in a next startup).

Just in case, this behavior could be disabled in Settings/Drive.
