If you’re interested in some good looking and well-made racing cars, take a look at [url="http://racesimstudio.com/"]Race Sim Studio[/url]. Their cars look and sound great, and even fit all usual Kunos limitations and contain all features required, such as, for example, properly implemented damage or dirt maps, which is a rare thing to find in mods. And some of those cars support some CM features as well! 😃
