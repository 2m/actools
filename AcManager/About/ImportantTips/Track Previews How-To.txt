Race will be started as usual, but instead of driving you need to make some picturesque shots (you'll be able to choose one of them later).

Hints:
 • Press F8 to make a shot;
 • Press F7 to switch to a Free Camera mode;
 • In Free Camera mode use arrows to move camera around; also you may hold Ctrl or Shift to adjust its speed;
 • And, as usual, PageUp/PageDown allow to tune exposure.

Good luck!
