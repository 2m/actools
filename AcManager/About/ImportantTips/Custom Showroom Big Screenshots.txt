Not sure why would you need it (apart from downsizing it later to get the best antialiasing available), but now CM is able to create 15360×8640. It could be much more, but screen-space effects (SSAO or SSLR) won’t work — to make “screenshot” this big, CM breaks image to a lot of parts. Even at 15360×8640, in some views, those effects will break.

To make a shot:

 • Go to fullscreen mode (F11);
 • Press Ctrl+Shift+F8 (without “+Shift”, CM will downsize image twice automatically);
 • Wait for a while.

To combine all pieces together, you could either use something like ImageMagick (just go to [url="https://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php"]this page[/url], download portable version for Windows, put “montage.exe” to result folder or, for example, to current user’s folder (so it will be available in CMD) and then, just run “join.bat”) or simply go to Settings/Plugins and install “ImageMagick Montage” before making a screenshot.
