name: AC settings and sharing
sid: 23_623075211_-737936088

First of all, [b]we finally added AC settings[/b]. Go to [i]Settings[/i] tab (F4) and switch to [i]Assetto Corsa[/i]… subtab? (I should definetly add some hotkeys for subtabs.)

Video, audio, gameplay, even some system settings (such as Developer apps or Free camera) are finished. Some of them have wider diapason than original ones. By the way, if you have a suggestion about adding a new setting or expanding an existing one, please, [url="https://trello.com/c/ZG9kuX01/18-ac-options"]tell us[/url].

Control settings, on the other hand, are still quite WIP — you can load and save presets, tune pedals, steering wheel, buttons, switch between wheel or keyboard modes or tune FFB, but everything about proper handling joystick changes (detaching/reattaching steering wheel, for example) is still not ready. And, of course, Xbox 360 controller (I don’t have one, so it will take some extra time).

[b]Another new feature is Sharing[/b]. Now you can press that button and direct link to preset page (such as [url="http://acstuff.ru/s/smt#noauto"]this[/url]) will be copied to the clipboard (although preset page isn’t required — CM basically works with links like [mono]acmanager://shared?id=smt[/mono], without that page everybody who doesn’t have CM installed won’t see anything, not even a error message). I'm not sure how it will work in real cases (or is it a good idea at all), so let’s see. At the moment only Quick Drive and Controls presets are supported, more (such as cars setups) will be ready soon.

[i]If you think that page design looks suspiciously similar to the Telegram one, you’re not wrong. I don’t think I could ever design something better. :)[/i]

Also, sorry for messed up unseen marks. You can use “Mark All As Read” option from context menu.
