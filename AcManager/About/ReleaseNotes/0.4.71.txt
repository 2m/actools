Introduce [b]Starter+[/b]! It works with Steam (including archievments and overlay) and, at the same time, should work without Internet and less conflict with original Kunos launcher. You can enable it by installing its addon and selecting option in Drive section of options.

Also, if your AC version is able to start the game directly without any tricks (only by launching [i]acs.exe[/i]), [b]Naive Starter[/b] was added.

And, of course, couple of beta-related changes: special option, which allows to upgrade only to tested versions (enabled by default) and button for automatically sending logs (please, use it in case of crashes).
