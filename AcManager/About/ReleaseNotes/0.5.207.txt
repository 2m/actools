name: Default previews preset updated (again)
sid: 39_159912475_-1471391675

[i]Honestly, it’s starting to get on my nerves.[/i]

Kunos previews preset changed again, now they returned to using S1-Showroom. Please, open Auto-Update Previews settings and reset to Kunos preset if you’re using their style.

Some of other changes since the recent notes:

 • [b]Information Finder[/b]
That old thing from Cars Manager, I think it’s quite useful one. Now you can select from a range of search engines (if you need some which not in the list, please, [url="https://trello.com/c/1HrHi37u/32-other-suggestions"]tell[/url]).

 • [b]Weekends[/b]
If future I'm planning to add fully customizable grids. Also, if you need Drag-races, please, tell (I’m not sure if anybody ever used them).

 • [b]New packing system[/b]
As a replacement for [url="http://enigmaprotector.com/en/aboutvb.html"]Enigma VB[/url] since almost all AVs (even Windows Defender) are getting angry at it. Transition still may cause some troubles (but most of them are fixed). Please, [url="https://trello.com/c/6PLhkQXe/33-other-bugs"]tell us if there is something wrong[/url].

 • [b]Online sorting[/b]
Of course, UI will be reworked, but for now like this, sorry.

 • [b]Lite Showroom improvements[/b]
Now it has some new features such as texture/materials viewing, UV exporting or ambients shadows updating (using much better algorithm than before). [url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-ar6rcNP0s"]Video demonstration[/url].

About current plans, right now missing features from Cars Manager are being moved to Content Manager.

Thanks for support, by the way, it really inspires us! :)
